      designation: "Google Research Brain"
      content:
        "Dr. Pedregosa's research has focused in the last years in developing an
        average-case analysis of optimization algorithms using techniques from random matrix theory. 
        Previously, he has been one of the founding members of the scikit-learn machine learning library. 
        His blog contains several posts on introductory optimization concepts and he has given invited lectures at McGill, UC Berkeley and ENSAE."

      designation: "Assistant professor at McGill University"
      content:
        "Dr. Paquette’s research broadly focuses on designing and analyzing algorithms 
        for large-scale optimization problems, motivated by applications in data science. 
        Her recent work has focused on average-case complexity that combined aspects of optimization and random matrix theory. 
        She is a CIFAR Canada AI chair with the Quebec AI institute (MILA)."

      content:
         "Dr. Trogdon’s work focuses on connections between classical algorithms
         from numerical linear algebra and random matrix theory. He is a core member of a
         group of researchers that have, first, discovered that the runtimes of algorithms exhibit
         universal distributions, and second, began rigorously establishing theorems."

        and include topics such as random matrix theory and generalization in high dimensions, 
        the role of overparameterization, wide neural networks and their corresponding kernels, 
        the dynamics of learning, and the geometry of high-dimensional loss surfaces."
